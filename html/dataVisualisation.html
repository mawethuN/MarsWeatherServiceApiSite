                Nasa NEO API, which stands for Near Earth Object Web Service. the NASA NEO API serves as a valuable resource for monitoring and studying Near-Earth Objects, helping to ensure the safety of our planet and advancing our knowledge of the solar system. It supports a wide range of scientific, educational, and practical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                This API provides data and information about NEOs, their characteristics, and their close approaches to Earth. Let's break down the URL parameters and explain the significance of this API:
            </p>
            <p>
                start_date: Determines the beginning date of the data query, set to "2015-09-07."
end_date: Specifies the end date of the data query, set to "2015-09-08."
            </p>
            <p>
                The bar graph pictured here represents an individual Near earth Object recorded on the 7th of September 2015.
                The numbers on the x axis represent each neo and show which one was first.
                due to the arrangement of the x axis, the numbers are displayed in descending order from the neo with the highest speed to the one with the lowest speed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The full graph is represented with all the present dates and information on the speed of neos for other dates.

            <p>
                This information is further expanded upon through the use of an interactive graph that displays neos, kph, and other statistics.
