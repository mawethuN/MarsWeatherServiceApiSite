                            "Data can be beautiful, and in the hands of an artist, it becomes a masterpiece." - Aaron Koblin 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For years we have collected data, both knowingly and unknowingly.
                            We gather information and use it for different purposes. We see this
                            happen everyday, Information gets processed differently and we
                            receive it in a multitude of ways. From the news anchor updating us on
                            world events, to the meter number at the gas station. Money, sports,
                            entertainment, politics, all of it is repackaged data shown to us in a way
                            we can understand. But what if I told you there was another way to see
                            this data?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this article, the topic of data art will be discussed and analysed. It
                            will explore the working definition of data art along with some
                            historical context. Furthermore, this article will reflect on the data art I
                            have chosen to display, along with the communication of strategies I
                            intend to implement. I will expand on my reasoning behind it all, which
                            will be followed by a swift conclusion.

                        <h3>WHAT IS DATA ART</h3>
                            <img src="../blogImages/jennliv-big-data_wide-35f6811fa2df6e0b1a67a194d25255780871c4d6.png" alt="image of a pixelated illustration of a woman touching her face with both palms of her hands">
                        <p>
                            According to Viégas and Wattenberg, data art is a tool used to visualise
                            data (Viegas. Wattenberg, 2018). This visualised data is then used to
                            support reasoning behind this data set. According to Dr. Kirell Benzi,
                            data-driven art is a data set that has been turned into an emotional art
                            piece (Benzi, 2017). This art piece aims to tell a story, whether its about
                            the data or not, and aims to create an emotional response to those who
                            view it.

                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            According to an article called “the digital age of data art” by Maxence
                            Grugier, the origin of data art, or informatism, began with Kynaston
                            McShine who is well known minimalist artist. McShine is credited as
                            being the one who further defined data visualisation into a category of
                            visual representation that could further elaborate on the given data
                            (Benzi, 2017).

                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            Here the article goes on to explain and link scientists to artists, stating
                            that data art is essentially a combination between art and science that
                            requires an individual who delves in scientific research and is also
                            artistic enough to convey those findings as a story. This form of art is one that is non-conventional and goes beyond what
                            is thought to be the norm.

                        <h3>DATA VISUALISATION VS DATA ART</h3>
                        <img src="../blogImages/parsonsheader.png" alt="image of a bubble graph/bubble data art">
                        <p>    
                            From what I have gathered between both Benzi and Viegas, data-driven
                            art seems like somewhat of a sub-section of data visualisation (Benzi,
                            2017) (Viegas. Wattenberg, 2018). Data Visualisation is reintroducing
                            data in the form of informative graphs that give clear indication of the
                            data and its components. From data visual graphs you can get specific
                            times and dates of when the data was logged and captured. Data
                            visualisation, in my opinion, is an umbrella term for the different types of visuals that fall under repackaged data. Under this term is where you
                            will find data graphs and data art.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The difference between data graphs and data art is that data art uses the
                            dataset not to convey times and locations, but rather as points to build
                            an image and create a narrative. Although data graphs do incorporate
                            colours and other visual aspects, they are not stand alone images. They
                            may share information but they dont necessarily tell a story.

                        </p>
                        <h3>MY VISION</h3>
                        <img src="../blogImages/csm_M2D1906_Data_Art_Mono-3_6863776c0d.jpg" alt="image of a data visualised moon">
                        <p>
                            What I want to achieve is essentially an image that correlates to the data
                            I am currently using for my website. I want to use the data set to create
                            an image of an asteroid or a comet as seen in the image below. The way
                            I intend to implement this is through the use of the given data, along
                            with the use of D3.js for the visual aspects.

                        </p>
                        
                        <img src="../blogImages/20231019_201828 (1).jpg" alt="image of my data art wireframe">
                        <p>
                            I am in the works of implementing it into my website. Initially I wanted
                            to make it a sort of line illustration where lines are connected to dots to
                            overall showcase a picture of an asteroid or a comet. I have played
                            around with the idea of using bubble graph to illustrate this instead.
                            The bubble graph would start off by showing the highest number of
                            near earth objects to the lowest. In order to create the image, I am
                            thinking of making the day of the highest number of NEOs into a large
                            grey circle with the other days tailing behind as small blue, grey, and
                            white circles that represent a tail of a comet.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I chose grey for the large circle because from most images seen,
                            asteroids are grey or have earth related hues to them. His is done to
                            catch the readers eye and to convey the main object to be viewed. The
                            smaller circles will be shades of blues and greys and white so show the
                            tail of the comet, thus making it seem as though it is still shooting across
                            the sky. I also intend to make the background of the image black to
                            further enhance the image or the story being told by the image.
                            I think the bubble graph iteration would essentially enhance the
                            meaning of the data set. It would make sense for a data art picture to be
                            related to the given data so as to instil a sense of foreboding within the
                            viewer that objects that likely seem so far away are actually closer than
                            once thought.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reaction I want the viewers to feel is a sense of contemplation. I
                            want those who will see this body of work to think about near earth
                            objects and how they could impact the planet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                        <p>
                            To conclude this article, I would like to state that data driven art is more
                            than a science, but rather an artform that enhances the meaning behind
                            the data provided. The art, as defined by scholars like Viégas and
                            Wattenberg, is a powerful tool for visualizing data with the aim of
                            enhancing our understanding of complex datasets. Dr. Kirell Benzi
                            adds a point to data-driven art by stating that it is transforming raw data
                            into captivating art pieces that tell stories and evoke emotions. Overall,
                            my data art will further enhance the understanding of NEOs and will
                            bridge the gap between science and art.
