                        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p>
                            User Interface and User Experience are the key components that shape our communication within the digital world. UX/UI often dictate the way in which we are to respond to a product. These interactions are extremely crucial, especially when designing front end products to be displayed on screens. Everything must be designed in a way as to not exclude anyone while making the experience enjoyable.
                            In this article I will be expanding on my design process and how I went about conducting my UI/UX design. I will do so by highlighting the principles of UI/UX that have been discussed within this degree, along with additional readings related to recent weeks as they too also focus the importance of Data Visualisation and how to properly style data on a website.

                        <h2>STORYTELLING WITH DATA</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although I have not yet arrived at the part whereby, I implement Nasa data into my website, I have read the Knaflic reading prescribed in week 4 which mainly focused on design being used to grab the attention of users (Knaflic, 2015). The reading spoke about the importance of using UI to make sure the user gravitates towards what’s most important on the screen. This reading also touches on memory, and describes 3 types of memory that developers and UI designers must take note of. These 3 types of memory include short-term memory, iconic memory, and long term memory. According to Knaflic, iconic memory is subconscious level memory and is mainly dictated by the environment you are in. Iconic memory is able to subconsciously view large quantities of information while subconsciously storing it and processing it into short-term memory (Knaflic, 2015). Short term memory is the somewhat temporary stage of digesting information whereby the user will most probably remember one thing from an entire collection of information. Usually that one thing can be associated with colour which has its own section of connotations that subconsciously dictate what the users should pay attention to. The more important something is, the more interested we become in learning more about it which develops into long term memory. Here we find that the fragment of information consumed by the user lasts longer in their memory to a point where certain word could trigger a response related to that information.

                            Why is this necessary or important for this article? Well to put it shortly, Knaflic goes on to further elaborate the ways in which we can use this knowledge of memories to further better the user interface of what we are developing. Knaflic suggests using pre-attentive attributes when developing or creating websites may be one of the key things to guarantee UI/UX success. Knaflic has other principles that have been stated in different chapters that helped to further develop this website.

                        <p>
                            For this assignment, I decided to revisit the site I did last semester. I read through all the feedback and compared it to other websites. Since this semester we will be using Nasa’s API, I decided to do a weather-based website that uses an open API from NASA called INSIGHT: MARS WEATHER SERVICE. This API shows the data collected on Mars, in an area called Elysium Planitia near the equator. The data consists of temperature, wind, and pressure measurements.
                            I created a template of what the website will look like when finished. This is what I hope to achieve by the time I am done with this website. I used the website called FIGMA to create these wireframes. Each frame or picture represents a different page on the website.

                        </p>
                        <h2>LAYOUT</h2>
                        <img src="designImages/MWS WEBSITE LAYOUTESSAY WIREFRAME.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>
                            I designed these pages to resemble a loop of endless scrolling.  It was meant to mimic scrolling down a page whereby each page has remnants of the last page.
                            I tried to follow Knaflic’s rules about UI by reducing clutter while also making sure I can still use pre-attentive attributes (Knaflic, 2015).
                            I made sure to put the text at the centre of the page seeing as how other blogs centered around articles often do that in order for the content to work harmoniously with the amount of white space around. I specifically wanted a bit of writing on the pages and a lot of white space or images to highlight the importance of the conveyed information. 
                            The only time the user would leave the main page is when there is interaction with the blog posts that send them to a different window.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>THEME AND COLOUR</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main theme and colour for this website is red, or rather different hues of burgundy. I wanted the background to be dark enough for the white to pop. I’m not entirely sure if that would count as a pre-attentive attribute but I implemented it to be able to catch the attention of the users.
                            I also made a sort of gradient that shifts in the background in order to allow important articles of writing and pictures to pop without the sharp contrast of moving from dark to light. Components like the graphs and blog post images must be visible to all users which is why the use of the light background will be implemented.
                            Colours like blue hues will be implemented to counter the warm burgundy accent within the website as another form of pre-attentive attribute, as seen in figure 2 below whereby the graph is a sharp contrast to the overall burgundy colour.

                        <br>
                        <h2>INTERACTIVITY AND UI</h2>
                        <p>
                            A lot of the things seen on these pages are meant to be somewhat interactive. An example would be the images on the blog post seen in figure 3. When hovered over, there is a short animation that indicates that the actual image is in fact a button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When interacting with the data or graphs, The user is supposed to be able to retrieve information whilst hovering over certain components of the actual graph. When scrolling, the planet on the home screen will rotate and the navbar background will become transparent, leaving only the navigation bars that are highlighted when the cursor hovers over them. See figure 4.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>SELF REFLECTION AND IMPROVEMENT</h2>
                        <p>
                            The only form of self-reflection I have is my weakness to fully implement JavaScript into this website. The main component that would determine this website’s success is the JavaScript element attached. I have already mapped out the systems that will be used in this website, and all that’s left is to implement them.
                            This has been a drastic change from my previous submission, but I am certain this current development is enough to guarantee success.
