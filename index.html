                <h1>What is MSW</h1>
                <p>
                    NASAâ€™s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) 
                    on the surface of Mars at <strong>Elysium Planitia</strong>, a flat, smooth plain near Mars equator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This API provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last seven available Sols (Martian Days). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As more data from a particular Sol are downlinked from the spacecraft (sometimes several days later), 
                    these values are recalculated, and consequently may change as more data are received on Earth.
                    Additionally, please note that wind and other sensor data may not exist for certain date ranges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can check out https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/ and scroll down to the 'seasonal weather report' 
                    you'll see the gaps where no data exists for some sensors.

                <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
                <P>
                    Designing a website is a journey where creativity meets strategy. I kick off by understanding the project's purpose and audience. Research helps me grasp trends and user preferences. Then, I sketch out initial concepts and build wireframes for layout. Once approved, I dive into crafting high-fidelity mockups, carefully selecting colors, fonts, and visuals. The development phase brings designs to life, adding functionality and responsiveness. But it doesn't end there; usability testing ensures a seamless user experience. It's a meticulous process that fuses aesthetics with user-centric design, resulting in a website that's not just visually pleasing but also highly functional.
