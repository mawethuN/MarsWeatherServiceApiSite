                    <h1>OVERVIEW OF DATA VISUALISATION</h1>
                    <article>
                      <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <P>
                        In this blog post, I will be talking about Data Visualisation, the importance of
                        Data visualisation, along with the different forms of visualising data.
                        DATA VISUALISATION DEFINITION
                        Qi uses many articles and scholars to figure out the definition of Data
                        Visualisation. Through combining and narrowing down the given definitions, I
                        was able to conclude that Data Visualisation is when data is represented in a
                        pictorial or graphic setting. Data Visualisation is the action of combining and
                        predicting patterns throughout the years and reintroducing them in a visually
                        pleasing format. As opposed to the scripted way of consuming data, data is now
                        represented through visually acceptable formats like bar graphs, Pie Charts,
                        scatter plots, and many other ways. Data has since expanded on the forms it has
                        to be visually represented which is thanks to the advancement of technology.
                        Compared to a few hundred years ago, we now have multiple digital formats that
                        can be use to further simplify data while simultaneously making it easier for the
                        vast majority to consume. Although Data varies, it is now extremely close to
                        being accurate if we take into account the ever-changing flow of new information,
                        especially on the world wide web.

                        <h2>DATA AND INFORMATION</h2>
                        <p>
                        We as people ad surfers of the web, consume vast amounts of data daily. This is
                        a large quantity of information that has to be filtered in order to be able to
                        represent itself as either factual or interesting. Qi states that there are 2 types of
                        data, primary and Secondary data. Primary data is described to be the first contact
                        data (Li, 2020). This is information collected from the source that is then later
                        processed into actual data. It takes a more individualistic approach by combining
                        the answer of questions proposed through research and creating a statistic that
                        can somewhat accurately represent the data. Secondary data is using previously
                        established information or data, and repurposing it to include more data or to
                        reshape it into consumable data. An example I came up with was anime and
                        manga. The manga is seen as a primary source of the creatorâ€™s original thought
                        and ideas of how the story is meant to be told, whereas the anime adaptation of
                        that manga has taken what information there was in order to turn it into a medium
                        that some could consider easier to consume.

                        <h2>TRADITIONAL FORMS OF VISUAL DATA</h2>
                        <p>
                        There are a number of traditional ways in which data is visualised. We have
                        Scatter Plots, Tables, graphs, diagrams and graphs. Each have their own unique
                        fixtures that make them important and relevant in terms of daily use. The most
                        common I have seen is the Scatter graph. This is mostly used on social media
                        platforms to indicate data about the different users across the world. An example
                        would be the most searched topics on Reddit and which regions they are from.
                        We used bar graphs in high school, specifically in science related subjects in order
                        to determine the hypothesis of a subject. With each form of visualisation, there is
                        a field that uses it in order to get accurate data, that can garner factual results.
