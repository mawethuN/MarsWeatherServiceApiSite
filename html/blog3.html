                        <p>
                            HCI also known as Human Computer Interaction is defined in this 
                            passage as the relationship between a person and their technology. From 
                            other sources it is described as the way in which human beings engage 
                            and interact with computer systems. In this field of study, it is also 
                            recognised that more attention is placed upon the design of the computers 
                            and how they garner interaction between the technology and humans. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As 
                            interesting as it is to learn about the definition of the HCI, there is still a 
                            remaining gap whereby we still donâ€™t know how exactly the HCI is related 
                            to visualisation and interaction within data visualisation (Dimara & Perin, 2020)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this blog post, I will summarise a reading we were given about defining 
                            what Interaction means for Data Visualisation by Dimara & Perin called 
                            What is Interaction for Data Visualization?. Furthermore, I will also give 
                            examples on what and how interaction of data visualisation is a key 
                            component of computers and design technology and how crucial it is that 
                            there is a correlation between these two. To achieve this, I will also use an 
                            article published on Unearth titled 9 Steps to Interactive Data 
                            Visualizations by Merica & Eagan
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>INTERACTION AND DATA VISUALISATION METHODS AND PROCESSES</h3>
                            <img src="../blogImages/images.png" alt="image of the human centered design process">
                        <p>
                            In this reading, there are talks of methods of collecting data and input in 
                            order to capture the view of interaction in visualisation. There are a number 
                            of processes used to get this information which include a Methodology 
                            Rationale, Questionnaire, Paper Collection, Paper Tagging, and 
                            Summary Statistics (Dimara & Perin, 2020). Each methodology is a step that 
                            takes place in the process of generating a result that can be used to best 
                            understand how exactly we get input from interacting with visualisation.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            I had a very hard time trying to understand what it was trying to say or the 
                            overall methodology process, so instead I turned to another article by 
                            Bryan Merica & Matthew Eagan titled 9 Steps to Interactive Data 
                            Visualizations that explained in detail how the previous steps mentioned 
                            are broken down into 9 steps that are easily digestible (Merica & Eagan, n.d.).
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            The article breaks down the methodology into 3 categories which the 
                            steps are listed under. These steps include: Available, Accessible, and 
                            Actionable (Merica & Eagan, n.d.). From what I have gathered, Availability is 
                            closely linked to researching and evaluating whether there is data to be 
                            gathered and what type of data it is. I link Availability to Methodology 
                            Rationale and questionnaire. I
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            . I say this because under Availability there 
                            is:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Step 1: Identifying the goal or objective.</li>
                                <li>Step 2: Understanding data limits.</li>
                                <li>Step 3: Design Conceptual Model</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Accessibility is data retrieval and processing, which is essentially the 
                            same thing as Paper Collection and Paper Tagging. This is the step in 
                            the process whereby the data is collected and sorted. Accessibility
                            includes:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Step 4: Source and Model Data</li>
                                <li>Step 5: Designing the User Interface</li>
                                <li>Step 6: Build Core Technology</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The last step is Actionability. This section I can also say relates to the two 
                            previously mentioned steps which are Paper Collection and Paper 
                            Tagging. Actionability not only includes the resolution of the process but 
                            rather includes additional processing of data before a resolve, or in this 
                            case a Summary Statistic of the review
                            <ol>
                                <li>Step 7: User Test and Refine</li>
                                <li>Step 8: Launch to Targeted Audiences</li>
                                <li>Step 9: Stay Updated</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        

                        <p>
                            Of course these steps differ to the reading but the point is fairly still the 
                            same. The process is one that may have different methods but is used to 
                            tackle a similar problem to generate a similar resolve 
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO DESIGN TECHNOLOGIES AND HUMANS</h3>
                        <img src="../blogImages/5242693154766848.png" alt="image of the a computer showing interactivity">
                        <p>
                            To answer this question, I will mostly refer as to why I stated the process 
                            in the previous section. From my understanding of both articles and the 
                            topic at hand, the reason why this process is needed is to ensure that the 
                            correct information is utilised in order to create informative models that 
                            users can interact with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From what we have been learning in this module 
                            so far, these articles highlight the importance of human based interactions 
                            and how we use this data along with environmental data to re-purpose the 
                            data into something human beings can interact with. The more you interact 
                            with something, the more you are able to learn from and about it.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we were using space based data in our last assignment, it was 
                            important for us to receive the information in order to mould and shape it 
                            into something that would be digestible for the next person. This process 
                            is crucial in order for the next person to be able to use the data we 
                            reformed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In simpler terms, in order for humans to interact and relate to 
                            the design technologies and their systems, there must be visualisation that 
                            can allow interactivity which will be able to allow engagement between 
                            human and machine
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A real life example of this process is the weather app. There are numerous
                            weather based apps across all of our devices. These apps are not 
                            spawned out of nowhere. There is a team behind those apps that make 
                            sure information gets to you in a convenient way, and that convenience is 
                            due a number of micro teams that manage different aspects of the app 
                            that may seem inconvenient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within every large project or corporation 
                            these steps are applied. There is a team responsible for research that 
                            tackle the Availability steps of this process, who later give it to the 
                            marketing team or the team responsible for drafting out designs for 
                            systems and processes. Those people fall under both accessibility and 
                            actionability. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The people who actually process the data given and build 
                            the systems also fall under Actionability. All these steps taken are vital 
                            towards producing data that is interactable.

                        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, this blog post explores the relationship between Human Computer Interaction (HCI), data visualization, and the methodologies 
                            involved in understanding and harnessing interaction in this context. HCI
                            is defined as the interaction between people and technology, a concept 
                            closely tied to data visualization's aim to enable effective communication 
                            between humans and complex data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The post discusses the methodology 
                            used to capture and define interaction in data visualization, including steps 
                            like Methodology Rationale, Questionnaire, Paper Collection, Paper 
                            Tagging, and Summary Statistics. Furthermore, the post highlights the 
                            significance of human-based interactions in design technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It 
                            stresses the importance of gathering and reformatting data to create 
                            interactive models that users can engage with effectively. This process is 
                            critical for bridging the gap between humans and design technologies, 
                            allowing for meaningful interaction and engagement
                        </p>
