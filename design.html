                    <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1
                    <p>
                        Designing websites is my forte, blending aesthetics and functionality to create a flawless digital experience. My process begins with a thorough understanding of project goals, audience, and competition. Sketching, wireframes, and mockups provide a roadmap, and development adds interactivity. Usability testing ensures a user-friendly end product, merging creativity with strategy.

                    <p>
                        I created this website with a clear objective: to portray Mars as a familiar planet akin to Earth. The primary theme revolves around Mars, focusing on Mars weather data. My design process involved extensive visual research and studying weather programs to create a design reminiscent of NASA's site with an inviting, earthy ambiance. Initially, I chose the InSight API for its potential data richness but faced data limitations. To address this, I incorporated the NEO API for additional space-related data visualization. In the future, I may pivot the website to center around the NEO API if InSight remains incomplete.

                    <h1>My Website Design Journey</h1>
                        <p>
                            I began by revisiting last semester's website, aiming to identify areas for improvement based on the received feedback. Initially, my wireframes closely resembled the previous iteration. However, after submitting assignment 1 for this block, I decided to explore new styling options.

                    <h1>Color and Themes</h1>
                    <p>
                        For the color scheme, I opted for various shades of red, ranging from crimson to burgundy. These Mars-inspired colors were influenced by an earlier iteration. In the previous wireframes, I used a Mars image as a background, but it clashed with the text. To enhance readability and visual appeal, I switched to a gradient background, transitioning from earthy red to a soft pinkish hue, giving each section a distinct identity.

                    <h1>Navigation</h1>
                        <p>
                            The navigation bar on the home page (index) provides quick access to each section without the need for scrolling. Links within the sections lead to respective pages with detailed content. While I had planned animations, time constraints led me to prioritize them in the next assignment.

                    <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
                        <p>
                            Originally, I intended to incorporate elaborate D3.js graphs like bubble charts. However, due to missing information from the InSight API, I opted for simpler line and bar graphs. The data visualization section offers room for improvement, which I plan to explore further in the next assignment.
