                    <h2>Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the semester, the topic of data and data art have been discussed. These discussions were mainly to analyse and dissect the possible meaning behind data visualisations along with our review on how we used it on our semester projects. 
                            By now there should be an understanding of what Data Visualisations are and what they aim to convey with their data. 
                            To catch you up to speed, Data Visualisation is essentially the process of using collected data and repackaging it in a way that is visually digestible and easy to understand. 
                            Data Visualisation is also a parent term for the previously discussed topic of Data Art. 
                            Data Art is essentially taking the Data visualisation and adding an artistic flair. 
                            It’s when the information or data that was captured is further manipulated and shaped to create an art piece that portrays a meaning behind the information in the hopes of evoking an emotion from the audience.

                            This blog will highlight the importance of Data visualization art and representation. The blog will explore the following topics and will further elaborate on their meaning. 
                            The topics are as follows, The Art of Data, Ethics and Representation, Challenges and Criticisms. 
                            Which will be followed by an overall review of the topic and a swift conclusion. 
                            The blog will also further elaborate on the importance of this topic through the use of scholarly articles that elaborate on the topic at hand, and also give insight as to how data is perceived and represented in the visual aspect. 
                            These articles will also backup arguments made in this blog post and substantiate their reasoning behind them.

                        <h3>THE ART OF DATA</h3>
                        <p>
                            To start this discussion off, let us first analyse what it is that we are dealing with in this topic. Data as an artform is a platform for a multitude of discussions. This is due to there being multiple ways of assessing and analysing art. To convey the meaning behind data art, one must first understand what art is. Kidd discusses that in order to understand data art, one must first understand semiotics and the connotations associated with what that form of art could represent (Kidd, 2015). Now speaking of semiotics, lets revisit FVPA and revise the teachings of Stuart Hall with regards to art and representation. To start, we must first understand semiotics. What is semiotics? To put it briefly according to SignSalad.com, semiotics is the process of finding meaning. This may be finding meaning behind words, colours, patterns, and symbols. Stuart Hall defines semiotics as a means of finding out about an object and what it signifies. There is a meaning behind every object, whether it is miniscule or of vast importance (Hall,1997). Stuart Hall analyses art through understanding semiotics. To look at an art piece, one must analyse and annotate their findings (Hall,1997). From there, their annotations must be further analysed to spot any connotations reflected in the body of work that may signify a deeper meaning of the art piece and could further shed light on what it actually represents.

                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            In this context, data art is considered. Kidd discusses that visual context of the representation must be taken into consideration (Kidd, 2015). To take data from a source and represented in a manner that sheds light on a subject must be done in such a way that it would be somewhat easy for an audience to understand what it is that the data is representing. To be able to fully achieve this, the artist must undergo an ethical review of the information and their body of work to understand if their representation of the data is accurate in portraying the true meaning of the work. There must be no negative connotations of the body of work that do not relate to the artwork, which could further be portrayed as misrepresentation.

                            The colours and shapes used within the data art play a very large role in conveying the meaning behind the artwork. In FVPA first year, we learned that colours and shapes have meaning. They all have connotations associated with them. The colour red, in many instances, represents danger. Some symbols may not look the same but provide the same meaning. The colour red is somewhat synonymous with an image of a skull and bones. Both these visuals have a clear meaning that represent danger. Circles and triangles may be classified as shapes, but they too have their share of connotations. In DAP first year we were introduced to shapes and characters. We were taught that a circle is often used to portray something non-threatening, whereas a triangle is very much associated with negative connotations. The justification for this is that the edges of a triangle are sharp, which evokes a feeling or memory of pain, maybe from touching a thorn or having been hurt by something with a sharp edge. Circles are meant to represent softness. Bubbles, cotton balls, stuffed animals all have a spherical aspect to them that makes them come across as not harmful. Colours and shapes show why it is necessary for the artist to carefully analyse the data in order to be able to fully understand it and be able to ethically navigate the visualisations. Viegas and Wattenberg further emphasize this through explaining how aesthetics plays a role in capturing the attention of the audience and making them focus on a focal point of the art work that enables them to see the data (Viégas. Wattenberg, 2007).

                        <h3>CHALLENGES AND CRITICISMS</h3>
                        
                        <p>    
                            Although data art is art, and art is considered to be fluid and difficult to criticise, there are a few challenges that the data artist faces when creating this work. There are 3 main challenges that I will discuss that relate to data art. The challenges are as follows: Misinterpretation, Ethics and Ethical Dilemmas, and Commercialisation.

                        </p>
                        <h4>MISINTERPRETATION</h4>
                        <p>
                            Artists try their best to create work that resonates with feelings and emotions. As successful as most artists are at conveying their message, there are still moments of misinterpretation that occur whereby the audience misses the point of the artwork entirely and formulate their own understanding of what the artist was trying to convey. Misinterpretation is not easy on the artist because many could formulate their own meanings which could lead to altercations for the artist, who never intended for their work to go in that direction. This could often arise from lack of proper representation through semiotics.

                        </p>
                        <h4>ETHICS AND ETHICAL DILLEMMAS</h4>
                        <P>
                            Navigating ethical considerations becomes prominent when artists engage with sensitive or controversial data. The challenge lies in delicately balancing artistic expression with responsible data representation. Critics frequently question whether artists sufficiently weigh the ethical implications, especially regarding privacy, consent, and the risk of reinforcing societal biases
                        </P>
                        <h4>COMMERCIALISATION</h4>
                        <p>
                            The issue arises when The artist creates a piece so popular, that it becomes commercially available. This unfortunately means that the artwork might lose its value as time goes on and might lose its overall meaning. The artwork could also be reimagined by other artists who do not use the original data sets, which would render the meaning of the work to be useless due to the now lost meaning behind the data.
                        </p>

                        <h3>PERSONAL REVIEW</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                            I personally think that Data visualisation as an artform is one that is quite tricky to navigate. Artists have many things to consider that often poses as limitations to which they are unable to fully convey the rawness of the true meaning behind their thought process and why they created their works. On top of having to build the artwork, which is not an easy task to complete, the artist must be sure to know who and they are representing and how to go about it. As someone who is currently developing their own data artwork, its quite a challenge to say the least. Finding inspiration to best make the data make sense is tricky task

                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                        <p>
                            Data art is a powerful story telling tool that resonates with the audience’s emotions prompting deep reflection to occur. In understanding the art of data, Kidd's insights guide us, emphasizing the importance of semiotics and decoding connotations. Stuart Hall's teachings on representation add another layer, urging artists to delve into the meanings behind every visual element in their work. The interplay of colours and shapes, shows you the significance of thoughtful analysis to ensure that the data is ethical and accurately represented. Problems come up, especially the chance of people not understanding the art correctly, ethical issues with handling private information, and the chance that the artwork's real meaning could get weakened by turning it into a commercial product. In conclusion, representing data art is a difficult feat to pull off and it has its fair share of warnings and rules to adhere to. I hope this blog has given some insight into what it means to build data art.
